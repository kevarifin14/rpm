    George was successful in his goal of architecting a fully functional
    platform for managing a portfolio of solar assets.  However, he saw that
    this platform’s scalability was limited by the tools and manual processes
    that it relied upon.  As SolarCity’s customer base approached 100,000
    contracts and executive leaders set targets to reach half a million within
    the next few years, it became apparent to George that a software solution
    was required in order for financial operations to efficiently scale with
    the business.
